# Menthol
>Canvas-based UI Framework for Web Applications

# About
This framework allows to develop web-applications and use *canvas* as user interface instead of DOM and HTML.
The main target of project is to provide fast, flexible and easy API interface similar to some of mobile platforms (Cocoa Touch, etc.)

Project is written on **TypeScript** and compiled to JavaScript (ES5) and currently in active development life cycle.

## Browser support
To use Menthol, your browser must support:
* Canvas API
* ECMAScript 5.1

# Usage
To start, clone this repo or install it from npm: `npm install kratos`.
For examples, look at **demo** folder at project or visit **[Wiki](https://github.com/odin3/kratos/wiki)** on GitHub for docs.

We strongly recommend to use TypeScript for development with this platform, but you can use plain JavaScript.
